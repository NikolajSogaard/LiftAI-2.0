TASK_MESOCYCLE_REVIEW = '''Analyze this training block and recommend changes for the next mesocycle.

Performance analytics:

Previous block summaries:
{}

User profile:
{}

Based on the analytics data, provide:
1. Your reasoning — what patterns do you see in the data?
2. Exercise swap recommendations — only for stalled or problematic exercises.
   For each swap, name the replacement and explain why it is a good variation.
3. Volume adjustments — any movement patterns that need more or less work.
4. Recommended mesocycle length for the next block.

Rules:
- Keep the same split structure (e.g., Upper/Lower stays Upper/Lower)
- Only swap exercises that have clear stagnation signals (2+ weeks no progress)
- Main compound lifts should only get variations, not completely different movements
- Accessories can be swapped more freely
- Do not swap exercises that are still progressing

Provide:
1. Your reasoning — what fatigue signals are you seeing?
2. Volume reduction plan — which exercises reduce sets and by how much
3. Intensity guidance — keep weight the same but raise target RIR by how much (leave more reps in reserve)

Rules:
- Reduce total weekly sets by approximately 40-50%
- Maintain exercise selection — do not swap exercises during a deload
- Keep weights the same or slightly lower, raise RIR targets by 1-2
- Prioritize reducing volume on exercises showing the highest fatigue signals
