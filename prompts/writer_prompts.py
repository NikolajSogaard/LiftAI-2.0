# Initial program creation task
TASK_INITIAL = '''
Create the best strength training program for this individual:
{}

STEP 1 — PLANNING (fill in the "reasoning" field):
Before writing the program, briefly think through:
- What training split and frequency fits this person's schedule, goals, and experience level?
- Which exercises and movement patterns are most appropriate and why?
- What weekly set volume is right for their level across all major muscle groups?

STEP 2 — PROGRAM (fill in "weekly_program"):
Output the complete program following this JSON structure exactly:
{}

Guidelines:
- Match the program precisely to the user's experience level, goals, available training days, equipment, and any injuries or limitations they mentioned.
- Ensure sufficient weekly frequency for every major muscle group (chest, back, shoulders, arms, quads, posterior chain).
- Order exercises sensibly: compound movements first, isolation work later.
- Keep weekly set volumes appropriate for the experience level.
- Make the cues field genuinely useful: a brief, specific coaching note on form or intent for that exercise.
- Set "level" to the lifter's training level (beginner / intermediate / advanced), inferred from their input.
- Tag each exercise's "patterns" with 1-2 of exactly these keys: Upper_horizontal_push, Upper_horizontal_pull, Upper_vertical_push, Upper_vertical_pull, Lower_anterior_chain, Lower_posterior_chain. A compound may list two (a back squat is ["Lower_anterior_chain", "Lower_posterior_chain"]).
- Supersets are OPTIONAL. When two or three exercises should be performed back-to-back (antagonist pairs, time-efficient accessory work, or when the user is short on time), give them the SAME "group" letter ("A", "B", ...) and list them consecutively within the same day. Keep main heavy compounds as straight sets with "group" set to null. Never force supersets.
- Intensity techniques ("technique" field) are OPTIONAL plateau-busters and default to null. Only apply one to the LAST working set of an ISOLATION or MACHINE exercise — never on heavy free-weight compounds. When warranted, set "technique" to a short label (e.g. "Drop set", "Myo-reps", "Lengthened partials", "Loaded stretch") and briefly explain how to execute it in the "cues" field. Use them sparingly — at most one or two per session for advanced lifters, fewer or none for beginners.

# Revision task based on critic feedback
TASK_REVISION = '''
Revise the program below:
{}

Based on feedback from your colleague below:
{}

IMPORTANT: 
- Address all the feedback provided in the critique and adjust the program based on those suggestions.
- Make sure to adjust the program according to the critique from: frequency and split, exercise selection, set volume, rep ranges, and RIR (Reps In Reserve).
- You MUST always directly implement all the suggested changes in the program itself from the critique, not just in the suggestion field.
- Maintain the same number of training days unless the feedback explicitly suggests changing it.

# Progressive overload task for Week 2+
TASK_PROGRESSION = '''
Create the next week's training program based on:

1) The previous week's program:
{}

2) The detailed feedback and performance data:
{}

IMPORTANT:
- ONLY modify the "AI Progression" field - keep all exercises, sets, rep ranges and rest periods identical
- YOUR RESPONSE MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY THIS FORMAT FOR LOAD ADJUSTMENTS WITH NO VARIATION:
  Set 1:(8 reps @ 80kg, RIR 3)
  Set 2:(8 reps @ 80kg, RIR 2)
  Set 3:(7 reps @ 80kg, RIR 1)
        75kg ↓

- YOUR RESPONSE MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY THIS FORMAT FOR REP ADJUSTMENTS WITH NO VARIATION:
  Set 1:(8 reps @ 80kg, RIR 3)
  Set 2:(8 reps @ 80kg, RIR 2)
  Set 3:(7 reps @ 80kg, RIR 1)
        10 reps ↑

- First line must be "Set 1:" followed by performance data in parentheses "(reps @ weight, RIR score)"
- Include ONE line per set showing the actual performance data from last week
- Then provide ONE line with ONLY the adjustment with arrow symbol - nothing else
- Use "↑" for increases and "↓" for decreases
- For weight changes: "85kg ↑" or "75kg ↓"
- For rep changes: "10 reps ↑" or "8 reps ↓"
- DO NOT include any other explanatory text whatsoever
- DO NOT include phrases like "Based on your performance" or "Aim for" or "Target RIR"
- DO NOT include any recommendations about RIR targets
- If no performance data is available, leave the suggestion field empty

IMPORTANT: Your AI Progression field must contain ONLY the set data and adjustment line as shown above.
